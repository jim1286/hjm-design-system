Make dark neutral surface edges and quiet text readable, and give secondary buttons and icon buttons a contrasting outline in both themes. The dark border now separates from every neutral surface at 3:1 or above; dark textWeak reaches 4.5:1 on those surfaces while retaining the text emphasis order. Secondary action borders use textSub through the shared recipe and Web CSS. ThemeColors and component props are unchanged; ghost actions remain transparent.

Consumers can remove overrides that only repair these default colors after upgrading the fixed package train together. See `packages/design-contracts/docs/migration-0.9.1.md` for contrast scope and remaining product-specific checks.

# @hjmds/react-native

## 0.9.2

### Patch Changes

- 564056c: Open the two entry points consumers were missing.

  `layoutStyle` reaches the component roots apps place directly. React Native gains
  it on `Stack`, `Text`, `Container`, `Section`, `Card`, `Tag`, `Switch` and
  `IconButton`; the web renderer gains the composition-style contract itself plus
  `Stack`, `Surface`, `Container`, `Grid`, `Text`, `Badge`, `Tag`, `Button`,
  `IconButton`, `CounterBadge`, `Switch` and `ListRow`. Placement is applied after
  the deprecated `style`, so layout wins. The allowed key set is unchanged, and the
  web set uses CSS logical properties so placement keeps its meaning under RTL.

  `resolveDesignSystemProviderValue` accepts a `brandPalette` that layers product
  colors over the semantic keys. The key set is untouched, so recipes and contrast
  rules keep applying. Without it a consumer had to build its own token layer and
  override the CSS variables, which duplicates the canonical palette.

  Both additions are additive: existing consumers keep working unchanged.

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- edeff8d: Improve UploadItem readability for RTL and 200% text, and align Native Switch, RadioGroup, SegmentedControl, and Tabs with the Web canonical props while preserving deprecated aliases.
- 6079dab: Make dark neutral surface edges and quiet text readable, and give secondary buttons and icon buttons a contrasting outline in both themes. The dark border now separates from every neutral surface at 3:1 or above; dark textWeak reaches 4.5:1 on those surfaces while retaining the text emphasis order. Secondary action borders use textSub through the shared recipe and Web CSS. ThemeColors and component props are unchanged; ghost actions remain transparent.

  Consumers can remove overrides that only repair these default colors after upgrading the fixed package train together. See `packages/design-contracts/docs/migration-0.9.1.md` for contrast scope and remaining product-specific checks.

- edeff8d: Document the React Native legacy raw-style enforcement gap and its pre-1.0 removal gate, add a reusable layout-only composition style API to Stable Core renderers, and deprecate unrestricted compatibility props without changing their runtime behavior.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- bc41bab: Promote the shared Surface, Button, Field, and TextArea renderer surfaces to Stable Core, and add the Container and AspectRatio contracts and renderers plus the Web VisuallyHidden accessibility utility.

  Document the public package governance, support, security, licensing, and external design-system gap analysis used for the additions.

## 0.8.2

### Patch Changes

- 794a2ce: Publish the renderers under the `@hjmds` npm scope. The previous `@hjm` scope is
  owned by another account, so the registry rejected every publish attempt. The
  release now targets `@hjmds`, which this project owns. The first registry version
  uses a one-time CI credential; subsequent releases authenticate through npm
  Trusted Publishing (OIDC) without a long-lived publish token.

## 0.8.1

### Patch Changes

- Publish to the npm registry after the tag and consumer evidence gate pass, so consumers install a semver range instead of vendoring a tarball or pinning a Git ref and package path. Also fix the yajalal consumer release gate's stale `develop` default branch and a Chromium background-tab timer throttling flake in the Tooltip browser test.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 12703fa: Expand the first-party Web and Native kits with `DatePicker`, `FilePicker`, `Steps`, and `UploadItem`; promote existing Link, Form, Avatar, Spinner, NumberField, Slider and parity renderers; add granular exports, bundle budgets, interaction tests, Storybook galleries, synchronized maturity/evidence artifacts, and a seven-scenario environment smoke matrix.

### Patch Changes

- 8d91f33: Add real Web and Native `PasswordField` and `OtpField` renderers with granular exports, shared contracts, catalog and Storybook evidence. Also add a renderer-neutral `Card.leading` slot with shared header spacing, align Native choice defaults with the shared card presentation, and fix Web fields so focus is drawn only around the rounded control.

## 0.7.1

### Patch Changes

- c17b104: Harden production renderer integration across Web and Native. Web anchored overlays now escape clipping boundaries, resolve viewport collisions and logical alignment, preserve grouped menu semantics, and coordinate modal priority and dismissal completion. Native renderers preserve product accessibility copy, test hooks, narrow-layout statistics, and root prop pass-through required by real consumer apps.

## 0.9.7

### Patch Changes

- fc51e46: Give `IconButton` the same `selected` toggle treatment `Button` has.

  `aria-pressed` / `accessibilityState.selected` already carried the state on an
  icon toggle — a sound switch, a notification bell — but without a paired visual
  every consumer painted the pressed state in product styles.
  `iconButtonRecipe.states.selected` mirrors `buttonRecipe.states.selected`, and
  `resolveIconButtonPresentation` takes the state as its third argument.

## 0.9.6

### Patch Changes

- 52770b7: Add the field `align` axis.

  A short, ceremonial single value — a nickname, a code — is centred in the
  control, and consumers expressed that with `inputStyle={{ textAlign: "center" }}`
  or a `text-align` override. `align` (`start` | `center`) makes it a recipe axis;
  `start` keeps following the resolved direction, so RTL is unaffected.

- 467ac3e: Add `minVisibleLines` to the multiline field, and bind the web field's multiline
  minimum to the recipe.

  `maxVisibleLines` already replaced `inputStyle={{ maxHeight }}`; a composer that
  should open several lines tall was still reaching for `inputStyle={{ minHeight }}`.
  The web renderer additionally carried `min-block-size: 80px` / `78px` in the
  stylesheet — numbers that duplicated `fieldRecipe.multilineMinHeight` and
  `paddingVertical` — and had neither bound axis. Both bounds are now expressed in
  lines on both renderers, so line height and vertical padding stay recipe-owned.

- c2e0edb: Give the React Native renderer the DOM accessibility contracts it needs on web.

  `accessibilityRole` and `accessibilityState` are translated by react-native-web
  into `role` and a subset of ARIA, but not the state attributes a screen reader
  reads: an expanded Accordion header, a checked ChoiceRow or Chip, and a selected
  Tab all reached the DOM without them. The keyboard contracts were missing too —
  `onPress` alone gives a `Pressable` no Space activation and no arrow traversal
  inside a radio group or tab list.

  `internal/web-a11y.ts` holds one copy of those contracts, spread only on web:

  - Accordion: `aria-expanded` / `aria-disabled`
  - ChoiceRow and Chip: `aria-checked` / `aria-disabled`, Space activation, and
    the WAI-ARIA radio-group arrow contract (focus and selection move together,
    skipping disabled and hidden options, wrapping, and leaving a `role="toolbar"`
    group to its focus-only contract)
  - RadioGroup: roving tabindex on the selected option, or the first enabled one
  - Tabs: `aria-selected` / `aria-disabled` / `aria-controls`, roving tabindex,
    Enter and Space activation, and orientation- and direction-aware arrow, Home
    and End traversal. Tab focus now uses DOM focus on web instead of the
    iOS/Android-only `setAccessibilityFocus` bridge call.

  This was carried as a `patches/@hjmds__react-native@*.patch` against `dist` in a
  consuming app, so every other consumer shipped the gap.

- 28f141f: Make `sunken` a real Surface tone that paints `surfaceAlt`.

  `semanticColors.surface.sunken` already named this role, but no Surface tone
  exposed it, so a consumer that wanted a recessed panel painted `surfaceAlt` in
  its own product styles. Worse, the React Native renderer carried `sunken` as a
  legacy alias for `subtle` — that is, for `bg`, the opposite direction from the
  role its own semantic layer defines. No consumer in this workspace used the
  alias, so the mapping is corrected rather than kept.

  `brand` remains a deprecated native alias for `accent`.

## 0.9.5

### Patch Changes

- 6440876: Replace the product style overrides that blocked consumer legacy-style migration with semantic axes.

  Auditing what consuming apps actually put in a legacy `style` prop showed five
  recurring overrides of recipe-owned values and five components that offered no
  `layoutStyle` at all, so placement had no legal expression.

  - `Button`: `shape` (`rounded` | `pill`) and `align` (`center` | `leading`)
  - `ListRow`: `leadingShape` binds `listRowRecipe.leadingSize`, which was
    declared but never rendered — every consumer rebuilt the avatar frame itself
  - `HjmProvider` (web): `host` (`surface` | `contents`) for a nested provider
    inside a product that already paints its own root
  - `layoutStyle` on `Chip`, `ListRow`, `Image`, `LoadMore` (native) and
    `DescriptionList` (web); their root `style` is now marked deprecated, and the
    layout-only slot styles narrow to `HjmCompositionStyleProp`

  - `Button`: `selected` paints the toggle treatment that `accessibilityState` /
    `aria-pressed` already claimed, and the `link` tone drops the size axis'
    horizontal padding so it aligns with the copy around it
  - `borderControl` joins `ThemeColors` as the resting outline of an interactive
    control, exposed as `semanticColors.border.control`. The secondary Button and
    IconButton tones drew that outline in `textSub`, a text color, which is the
    same mistake `chipRecipe` already documents; a product that needs a stronger
    control boundary than its surface hairline can now inject one semantic key
    through `brandPalette` instead of overriding `borderColor` per wrapper. The
    default value matches what the outline already resolved to in both themes.
  - Web `ListRow` binds the same density recipe the native renderer does. It used
    a single hardcoded `min-block-size: 56px` and never distinguished a one-line
    from a two-line row, so `oneLineMinHeight` / `twoLineMinHeight` /
    `paddingHorizontal` / `paddingVertical` / `gap` and the `leadingShape` frame
    are now emitted as `--hjm-list-row-*` variables and read by the stylesheet.
  - Web `Switch` binds `switchRecipe.sizes`. It had no `size` prop and the
    stylesheet carried 48/28/22/3px, which matched neither recipe size, so the
    axis was unbound on web and consumers re-implemented it with their own
    variables. Track and thumb geometry now read `--hjm-switch-*`.
  - `surfaceRecipe` gains `clipsContent`. A child image spilled past the rounded
    corner in every consumer, which each fixed with `overflow: hidden` in product
    styles — including the discovery that an elevated tone must opt out because
    clipping cuts off its own shadow. Both renderers bind it.

- 684c34a: Add the `minimumVisualTarget` provider environment axis.

  Compact recipes stay at 36pt and reach the 44pt target through hit slop. A
  product whose accessibility stance requires a _visible_ 44pt frame previously
  had to re-add `minHeight` in its own wrapper styles, which put control geometry
  back into product code. The axis resolves once on the provider environment and
  `visibleControlHeight()` applies it to the native Button and Chip heights and to
  the web `--hjm-control-button-*` variables, so every stylesheet rule that reads
  a control height follows without its own case.

## 0.9.4

### Patch Changes

- 8a1e6b0: Add `maxVisibleLines` so a growing multiline field can be capped without a caller style.

  Consumers were setting `inputStyle={{ maxHeight }}` on a composer, moving a
  recipe-owned dimension into product code. The field recipe already owned
  `multilineMinHeight`; this adds the matching upper bound expressed in visible lines,
  resolved against the input's own line height and vertical padding. The default stays
  unbounded, so existing behaviour is unchanged.

## 0.9.3

### Patch Changes

- 30d2acc: Fill the contract gaps that blocked consumer migrations off the deprecated `style` prop.

  `maxWidth`, `minWidth` and `flexWrap` join the composition key set. Width bounds and
  wrapping decide how much room a component may take in the consumer's own layout, which
  is placement rather than appearance; height stays out because the recipe owns vertical
  rhythm. The web set also accepts `maxInlineSize` and `minInlineSize`.

  `Section`'s `headerStyle`, `copyStyle`, `actionStyle` and `contentStyle` are narrowed to
  the composition style type, so a consumer can place a slot without moving recipe-owned
  appearance into it. `titleStyle` and `descriptionStyle` stay deprecated because
  typography belongs to the recipe.

  `Sheet` gains a `size` axis — `auto`, `medium`, `large`, `full` — exposing the
  `maxHeightRatio` the recipe already owned. Consumers previously set sheet height through
  `contentStyle`, which is now narrowed to placement only.

## 0.9.2

### Patch Changes

- 564056c: Open the two entry points consumers were missing.

  `layoutStyle` reaches the component roots apps place directly. React Native gains
  it on `Stack`, `Text`, `Container`, `Section`, `Card`, `Tag`, `Switch` and
  `IconButton`; the web renderer gains the composition-style contract itself plus
  `Stack`, `Surface`, `Container`, `Grid`, `Text`, `Badge`, `Tag`, `Button`,
  `IconButton`, `CounterBadge`, `Switch` and `ListRow`. Placement is applied after
  the deprecated `style`, so layout wins. The allowed key set is unchanged, and the
  web set uses CSS logical properties so placement keeps its meaning under RTL.

  `resolveDesignSystemProviderValue` accepts a `brandPalette` that layers product
  colors over the semantic keys. The key set is untouched, so recipes and contrast
  rules keep applying. Without it a consumer had to build its own token layer and
  override the CSS variables, which duplicates the canonical palette.

  Both additions are additive: existing consumers keep working unchanged.

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- edeff8d: Improve UploadItem readability for RTL and 200% text, and align Native Switch, RadioGroup, SegmentedControl, and Tabs with the Web canonical props while preserving deprecated aliases.
- 6079dab: Make dark neutral surface edges and quiet text readable, and give secondary buttons and icon buttons a contrasting outline in both themes. The dark border now separates from every neutral surface at 3:1 or above; dark textWeak reaches 4.5:1 on those surfaces while retaining the text emphasis order. Secondary action borders use textSub through the shared recipe and Web CSS. ThemeColors and component props are unchanged; ghost actions remain transparent.

  Consumers can remove overrides that only repair these default colors after upgrading the fixed package train together. See `packages/design-contracts/docs/migration-0.9.1.md` for contrast scope and remaining product-specific checks.

- edeff8d: Document the React Native legacy raw-style enforcement gap and its pre-1.0 removal gate, add a reusable layout-only composition style API to Stable Core renderers, and deprecate unrestricted compatibility props without changing their runtime behavior.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- bc41bab: Promote the shared Surface, Button, Field, and TextArea renderer surfaces to Stable Core, and add the Container and AspectRatio contracts and renderers plus the Web VisuallyHidden accessibility utility.

  Document the public package governance, support, security, licensing, and external design-system gap analysis used for the additions.

## 0.8.2

### Patch Changes

- 794a2ce: Publish the renderers under the `@hjmds` npm scope. The previous `@hjm` scope is
  owned by another account, so the registry rejected every publish attempt. The
  release now targets `@hjmds`, which this project owns. The first registry version
  uses a one-time CI credential; subsequent releases authenticate through npm
  Trusted Publishing (OIDC) without a long-lived publish token.

## 0.8.1

### Patch Changes

- Publish to the npm registry after the tag and consumer evidence gate pass, so consumers install a semver range instead of vendoring a tarball or pinning a Git ref and package path. Also fix the yajalal consumer release gate's stale `develop` default branch and a Chromium background-tab timer throttling flake in the Tooltip browser test.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 12703fa: Expand the first-party Web and Native kits with `DatePicker`, `FilePicker`, `Steps`, and `UploadItem`; promote existing Link, Form, Avatar, Spinner, NumberField, Slider and parity renderers; add granular exports, bundle budgets, interaction tests, Storybook galleries, synchronized maturity/evidence artifacts, and a seven-scenario environment smoke matrix.

### Patch Changes

- 8d91f33: Add real Web and Native `PasswordField` and `OtpField` renderers with granular exports, shared contracts, catalog and Storybook evidence. Also add a renderer-neutral `Card.leading` slot with shared header spacing, align Native choice defaults with the shared card presentation, and fix Web fields so focus is drawn only around the rounded control.

## 0.7.1

### Patch Changes

- c17b104: Harden production renderer integration across Web and Native. Web anchored overlays now escape clipping boundaries, resolve viewport collisions and logical alignment, preserve grouped menu semantics, and coordinate modal priority and dismissal completion. Native renderers preserve product accessibility copy, test hooks, narrow-layout statistics, and root prop pass-through required by real consumer apps.
